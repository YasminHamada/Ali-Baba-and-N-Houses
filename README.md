# Ali-Baba-and-N-Houses
Ali Baba has scoped out a line of N houses that you would like to rob tonight.  
However, he is realized that he wants to avoid robbing two houses that are adjacent 
to one another because this will minimize the chance that he gets caught. He has
also scouted out the hood, so for every house i, he knows that the net worth he will 
gain from robbing that house is V[i].
